**Postmortem: Incident Summary**

**Duration:** May 7, 2024, 9:00 AM - May 7, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)

**Impact:** The website's authentication service was down, preventing users from logging in. Approximately 30% of users were affected, leading to frustration and complaints from the user base.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection pool settings, causing a bottleneck and eventual exhaustion of available connections.

**Timeline:**

- **9:00 AM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication service errors.
- **9:10 AM:** Engineers investigated the issue, suspecting database connectivity problems.
- **9:30 AM:** Misleadingly, initial investigation focused on network infrastructure, leading to no resolution.
- **10:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the database administration team for further analysis.
- **10:30 AM:** Database administrators identified the misconfiguration and its impact on connection pooling.
- **11:00 AM:** Corrective measures initiated to adjust connection pool settings to allow for more connections.
- **11:30 AM:** Authentication service restored to full functionality following adjustments to database configuration.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection pool settings. Specifically, the maximum connection limit was set too low, causing a bottleneck when the service experienced a surge in user requests. To resolve the issue, database administrators increased the maximum connection limit and optimized connection pooling settings to ensure scalability and prevent future bottlenecks.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Perform regular audits of database connection pool settings to ensure they align with service requirements.
- Implement automated monitoring and alerting for database connection usage to detect and address potential bottlenecks proactively.
- Establish clear escalation procedures to expedite the resolution of critical service disruptions.
- Conduct regular training sessions for engineering teams to increase awareness of common misconfigurations and debugging techniques.

**Conclusion:**

The outage was a valuable learning experience that highlighted the importance of robust configuration management and proactive monitoring in maintaining service reliability. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future and enhance the overall resilience of our infrastructure.
